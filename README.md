## Overview
This repository allows to reproduce the results obtained in "Abunijela, PÃ¼tz et al. (2025) - Wastewater-based Surveillance as a tool for monitoring and estimating COVID-19 incidence and trends: Insights from Germany, 2022-2024". The analyses were conducted using R 4.4.1 (64 bit, Windows). You can recreate the project environment by using the `renv` package (https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv). To do this, make sure that you have the same R version, i.e. R 4.4.1, installed and that you run "install.packages("renv")" and then "renv::restore()" first.

## Folders in this repository
* `data`: This folder contains the datasets needed for the analyses. 
* `R`: This folders contains the R scripts called by `main.R` (located in the main directory) needed to replicate the results.
* `output`: This folder stores the figures and tables of the manuscript which can be reproduced by running `main.R`.
* `renv`: This folder contains files to recreate the project environment and need not be called directly, see https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.

## How to reproduce the results
If you use RStudio, open the `R` project 
`WBS_for_COVID19_monitoring.Rproj` in the main directory first, then no further adjustment should be necessary. If you do not use RStudio, you have to set your working directories accordingly by replacing  "here()" by your main directory  (e.g. "C:/WBS_for_COVID19_monitoring") and "R" by the appropriate folder (e.g. "C:/WBS_for_COVID19_monitoring/R") in the script `main.R`. To reproduce the results which are then stored in the `output` folder and its subfolders, run the script `main.R` which calls all R scripts stored in the subfolder `R`. The processing will take some minutes, especially at the first time when all packages have to be installed. The main part of computation time is needed by running the machine learning models. If you want to avoid this, open `prepare_data_for_analyses.R` and run that script only until line 51 instead of using `source(here("R", "prepare_data_for_analyses.R"), encoding = "UTF-8")`.

If you encounter any problems, make sure that you follow the instructions concerning "renv" as written above, i.e. install and use R 4.4.1, then run "install.packages("renv")", "library(renv)" and "renv::restore()" first (or delete the comments ("#") in lines 15, 16 and 19 in `main.R` and run that script). Furthermore, it might be that you have to confirm the installation of packages typing in "Y" in the console when running `main.R` for the first time and and that you might have to run `main.R` again after all packages have been installed.
